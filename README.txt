Programs:

1) The program 'ch_tumour_simple.py' is a simplified version of our programs. 
We modified the demo 'demo_cahn-hilliard.py' from the FEniCS homepage:

 https://fenicsproject.org/docs/dolfin/latest/python/demos.html


2) The directory 'program_1D_convergence' contains the programs solving the 
Cahn--Hilliard tumour system and computing convergence rates in one dimension
on the interval (0,1).


3) The directory 'program_2D' contains the programs solving the Cahn--Hilliard
tumour system in two dimensions on the square (0,12.5)^2.


4) The directory 'program_3D' contains the programs solving the Cahn--Hilliard 
tumour system in three dimensions on the cube (0,3)^3.
